I'm a French Android Engineer currently living in Sweden and working at [Lifesum](https://www.lifesum.com/).

I enjoy working on the Android ecosystem and creating new (some more useful than others..) apps. What I love the most is the learning experience I get in the process of building something new, something that I never really worked on before, something unique. Also working on a paltform that is used everyday by billions of users (including myself) is very motivating.

I have been doing Android development for more than 2 years now and released **[a few apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Nicolas%20Bridoux&hl=en)**. Thoses apps are not perfect but I truly believe they made me a better developer in the process. Some of them are [open source](https://github.com/Bridouille).

My main languages are `Kotlin` and `Java`, but I have some knowledge in low level programming (`C`, `Go`).

I spend the majority of my free time working on side projects when I find an idea that motivates me. My other passions in life are travels and working out. If you have any questions or simply want to say hi, shoot me an email and I'll be happy to discuss :)
