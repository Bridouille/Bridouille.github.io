Since I was young I have been attracted to computers and new technologies. After obtaining my high school diploma in scientific option with Honors, I started my Master in Computer Science at EPITECH (European Institute of Information Technology). While learning the C language at EPITECH, I realized that I had found my passion for Computer Science. As EPITECH's pedagogy is essentially based on practice, I have learned to adapt to a multitude of projects in different environments.

I first started learning how todayâ€™s web technologies are designed during my first two professional experiences with back-end and front-end development.

Over the past two years I turned to Android development and became deeply passionate about it. Since then I have made a few apps on my own and became Android Engineer at a young startup which contributed to strengthening my knowledge of the Android platform and solidified the idea that it is what I want my career to be.
